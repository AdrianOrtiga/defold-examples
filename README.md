Alien World is a complete game art pack to make a fantastic sci-fi platform metroidvania game in the style of the 16-bit console era. It includes everything you need, from seamless loopable backgrounds, tillable sprites, sci-fi props, some fearful enemies, mysterious NPCâ€™s and of course a Daring Hero. (Please give credit to Luis Zuno when you use the art in a game.)
